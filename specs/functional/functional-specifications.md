## Overview

Krug Champagne (part of LVMH) is building a new winery software that will focus on the blending stage of champagne making. The software will aim to produce the closest result to the formula with the minimum number of steps, while ensuring that there are no crashes or half full/half empty tanks, and the wine is never in contact with oxygen.

## Krug Champagne

Krug Champagne is a luxury brand owned by LVMH and is known for its high-quality champagne made using the traditional method. The Cellar Master, Julie CAVIL, and her team taste different combinations of wine for about 9 months until they find the perfect formula, which becomes the challenge of blending large quantities of wine in the right proportions.

## What is the Problem ?

The blending process in champagne making is a complex task that requires precision and expertise to achieve the desired flavor and texture. With 330 tanks of various sizes and a system of pumps and pipes that can connect any tank with any other tank, the winery needs a software solution that can optimize the blending process, reduce the number of steps required, and produce the closest result to the input formula.
