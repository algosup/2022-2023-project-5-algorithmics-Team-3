## Introduction

This document completes the Functional Specifications by bringing a more technical side of the design of our solution. Moreover for all the elements concerning the tests, this document will be supplemented by the Test Plan which contains all our approach of test on this project.
It is important to take into account these three documents together for a better understanding of our solution.

### Context and goals

#### Context

Krug Champagne (part of LVMH) is building a new winery and needs a software solution for their blending process. The traditional method for making champagne involves several complex steps, and blending is a critical step in creating a consistent flavor profile. The challenge is to blend large quantities of wine in the right proportions while minimizing the number of steps to produce the closest result to the formula. The software solution will need to leverage the 330 tanks of various sizes and a system of pumps and pipes that can connect any tank with any other tank.

#### Goals

The main objectives of the project are:

- To develop a software solution that automates the blending process of champagne production, with the aim of minimizing the number of steps required to achieve the closest result to the target formula.

- To leverage the available resources such as the 330 tanks of various sizes and the system of pumps and pipes to create a flexible and scalable solution that can adapt to different production volumes.

- To ensure that the software solution is easy to use, with a user-friendly interface that enables the Cellar Master and her team to experiment with different combinations of wines and track the progress of the blending process.

- To ensure the correctness of the software solution, with no crashes or errors, and that it meets the quality standards of Krug Champagne.

- To optimize the speed of the software solution, to minimize the time required for blending and improve the overall efficiency of the production process.

- To document the software solution and provide adequate instructions to the Cellar Master and her team to ensure a smooth transition to the new system.

These objectives will guide the development and implementation of the software solution and ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of Krug Champagne.

### Project overview

Reminder of the project elements:
**Project Name:** Algorithmics Krug Champagne

**Client:** Krug Champagne, part of LVMH

**Project Description:**

The software will be used for the new winery of Krug Champagne to assist with the blending process of champagne. The software will focus on stage 4: **blending, which involves blending still wines from different vineyards and grape varieties to create a consistent flavor profile.** The goal of the software is to produce the closest result to the desired formula with the minimum number of steps.

**Scope:**

The software will include a user interface that will allow the cellar master and her team to input the desired formula for the champagne blend. The software will then analyze the available wines and recommend the optimal combinations of wines to achieve the desired formula. The software will also manage the transfer of wine between tanks during the blending process, ensuring that the tanks are never partially full to prevent oxidation. The software will need to manage the inventory of the wine and tanks and ensure that the blending process is conducted efficiently and accurately.

**Deliverables:**

The software will be delivered as a desktop application that can be installed on the winery's computers. The software will be designed to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The application will have a user-friendly interface that will allow the cellar master and her team to easily input the desired formula and view the recommended wine combinations.

**Timeline:**

The project is expected to be completed by June 23, 2023, with at least one week allotted for testing and bug fixing.

**Budget:**

As no budget has been specified by the client, and we do not anticipate incurring any expenses, this project is expected to have no budgetary constraints.
