## 1. Introduction

1. **Understanding the Problem:** The blending process involves combining different wines in certain proportions to achieve a desired flavor. This is a multivariate optimization problem, where you're trying to find the best combination of wines that produces a blend that's as close as possible to the desired formula.
2. **Structuring the Data:** You can represent the tanks as nodes in a graph, where edges connect tanks that can be blended together. Each tank (node) can have attributes such as its current volume, its maximum volume, and the wine it contains. This way, you can keep track of which tanks are available for blending at any given time.
3. **Blending Algorithm:** Use a greedy algorithm for blending, where at each step you choose the blend that gets you closest to the desired formula. This approach will aim to minimize the number of steps. However, a global optimization algorithm such as simulated annealing or genetic algorithm might be needed if the greedy algorithm doesn't give satisfactory results.
4. **Handling Constraints:** To ensure no tank is left partially filled, the algorithm should only choose to blend wines if the resulting volume can be completely stored in one or multiple tanks.
5. **Speeding up the Code:** To make the code run faster, you can consider techniques such as memoization (to avoid recalculating results) or parallel processing (to utilize all available CPU cores).

The Test Plan is designed to prescribe the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities of the project Krug Champagne Algorithmics.

The plan identify the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.
