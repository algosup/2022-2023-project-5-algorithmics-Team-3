## Potential Roadblocks
Here, we list out the potential problems we can encounter during our project, the causes and how we could prevent them:

| Potential Issues                                           | Possible causes                                 | How to solve it                 | Priority                 |Impact                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
|<b>The results obtained are wrong and not what we expected</b>| There could be a miscalculation error when it tries to find the result;<br> the inputs doesn't correspond on what the algorithm needs to calculate. <br>Also, the blending system we conceived for making our simulations isn't really compatible, as the connections between each tanks and/or group of tanks aren't well organized.           | We have to make sure to find the right algorithm for our blending combinations; <br>Indeed, we can find a good example which is similar to our problem and make research on the algorithm we want to use depending on the different situation while simulating blending. <br>Furthermore, we need a full list of the rules and constraints the system must answer, check his similarities with the algorithm, and make simple blending tests to check if it's works. | HIGH | HIGH |
|<b>The algorithm takes too much time to output a result</b>| The algorithm uses too much parameters and their size could be too heavy for calculation.            | First of all, we need to check the first time how long the algorithm take to print a result. <br>Then, we have to get the big O Notation of the algorithm to classify it and adapt it; <br>And finally, we need to find optimization solutions to improve the speed and efficaceness of our formula. | MEDIUM| MEDIUM |
|<b>The interface used for our software isn't ready</b>| We took too much time building our software with the user-friendly interface and we are out of time to finish it.            | To start with, we have to decide what kind of product the software will look like (web application ? Simple code ?). <br>Then, we have to start to create a prototype of interface using the tools we have and find a way to put code into design, as we might be able to view the tanks' real time capacities. | LOW | MEDIUM |
